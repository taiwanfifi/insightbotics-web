I have a reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to my shorter front legs; I'm roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body.
I live in trees and feed mainly on bamboo, but I also eat eggs, birds, and insects.

I joined the IUCN Endangered species red list in 2008 as a result of a constant population decline caused by habitat loss, poaching and inbreed depression.
